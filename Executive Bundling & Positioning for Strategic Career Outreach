Objective:
Craft a concise, high-impact message for cold outreach or formal applications that communicates deep operational expertise, an unconventional background, and a forward-thinking leadership lens — especially for roles in performance improvement, operations consulting, or strategic transformation.

Build credibility outside traditional career molds

Core Elements Included:
Personal introduction with clear intent
Summary of value proposition (veteran, cross-functional leader, M&A, startup scalability)
