Analyze lifestyle design as the balance between sustainment (financial stability, health, time) and growth (career advancement, skills, wealth) over a 20-year horizon.
Model role checkpoints: Entry → Mid Specialist → Manager → Senior Manager/Director → Executive/Founder/Independent, showing how each impacts capacity (energy, cognitive bandwidth, liquidity) and velocity (rate of upward movement).

Incorporate the effects of a collapsing corporate structure:
Flattened hierarchies, shrinking middle management
AI/automation removing advancement ladders
Lateral mobility over vertical promotion
Generational value shifts
Rise of fractional/independent leadership

Evidence Standards
Provide 95% confidence or credible intervals for all metrics.
Include past (2005–2019), current (2020–today), and future (10–20 years) trends.
Use credible datasets (BLS, OECD, LinkedIn/Emsi, Burning Glass, World Bank, Pew, IMF) and cite all figures.
Show methodology, backtests, and sensitivity analysis; flag data limitations.

Required Outputs
20-Year Time Series Table – Year, Role, Capacity (±95% CI), Velocity (±95% CI), Median Comp ($ ±95% PI), Promotion Hazard (%/yr ±95% CI), Notable Structural Shifts.
Narrative Analysis – Evidence-based trends in capacity and velocity by role and life stage.
Strategic Recommendations – Role-specific tactics to sustain capacity and maximize velocity.
Scenario Modeling – Outcomes for:
Traditional Corporate Climb
Hybrid (Corporate + Ventures)

Early Independent Path
Include 10- and 20-year outcome ranges with 95% intervals.
Replication Guide – Data sources, modeling steps, and update process.
Format with tables, charts, and concise bullet points. Highlight inflection points where pivoting yields maximum capacity + velocity.
