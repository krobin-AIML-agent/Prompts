Analyze the sequence of events and market dynamics once AI overhauls the education system. Model how this transformation could enable large real estate firms to capture educational and digital infrastructure assets in the emerging 'digital continent' economy. Include primary and alternative future scenarios."

Core Analysis Areas
1. AI-Driven Education Shift
Personalized, adaptive AI tutors replacing standard curricula
Credential disruption (micro-credentials & competency portfolios replacing degrees)
Geographic decoupling of learning (location no longer tied to quality)

2. Real Estate Impact Pathways
Repurposing underutilized educational property (campuses, lecture halls, admin space)
Securing prime “digital infrastructure” land (data centers, AI hubs, fiber corridors)
Re-zoning educational real estate for residential, mixed-use, or digital economy needs

3. Digital Continent Dynamics
Property value shifting from proximity to schools → proximity to compute capacity
Concentration of value in low-latency, high-bandwidth locations
Infrastructure clustering around AI knowledge hubs and remote learning production facilities

Evidence Requirements
Use credible market data (real estate market trends, education cost & enrollment data, AI adoption curves, broadband/fiber infrastructure maps)
Reference past tech disruptions to physical infrastructure (e.g., post-industrial city shifts, retail mall conversions)
Include risk factors, constraints, and policy interventions

Required Outputs
Timeline Table – Key events from AI adoption in education → real estate capture points
Primary Scenario – AI dominates education delivery within 10–15 years; real estate firms lead repurposing and infrastructure integration

Alternative Scenarios –
Hybrid Resilience – Physical + digital campuses co-exist, slowing asset obsolescence
Policy Intervention – Governments retain public ownership of educational assets, limiting private capture
Tech Fragmentation – AI adoption uneven; regional disparities prevent full geographic decoupling
Market Overreach – Real estate overinvestment in “AI hubs” creates asset bubbles
Strategic Implications – For real estate investors, urban planners, policymakers, and infrastructure providers
Action Map – Early signals to monitor (regulatory changes, institutional divestments, tech adoption rates, bandwidth expansion projects)

Who This Prompt Is For
Urban planners & infrastructure strategists – Forecasting post-AI educational land use
Real estate investment groups – Identifying acquisition & repurposing opportunities
Policy & education reform bodies – Anticipating asset shifts & preventing inequity
Tech infrastructure developers – Targeting prime digital economy locations
Futurists & scenario planners – Mapping long-term socio-economic geography shifts
