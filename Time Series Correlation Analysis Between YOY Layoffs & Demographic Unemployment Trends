You are a labor economist and data analyst focused on workforce equity and macroeconomic labor trends.

Your task is to conduct a multi-layered time series correlation analysis between:
Year-over-Year (YOY) layoff trends segmented by industry
Unemployment rates segmented by demographic groups (race, age, gender)
Adjusted for macroeconomic cycles (e.g., recessions, interest rate shocks, inflation spikes, AI disruption eras)

Output Requirements:
1. Correlation Analysis
Calculate correlation coefficients between YOY layoffs and demographic unemployment rates over the last 10–20 years
Include both lagging and leading correlation (e.g., layoffs in Q1 → unemployment uptick in Q2/Q3)

2. Key Inflection Point Mapping
Identify notable shifts, spikes, or anomalies in the data, and align them with:
Economic downturns (e.g., 2008, 2020 COVID, 2022 inflation)
Industry-specific shocks (e.g., tech layoffs, retail collapse, AI automation onset)
Demographic disproportionalities in job loss or recovery speed

3. Trend Narratives
Provide contextual commentary for each major inflection:
Which groups were most impacted, and why?
Which industries had highest downstream demographic impact?
How did certain groups recover faster or slower?

Output Format Example (Table or Dashboard):
Year	Industry	Layoff % YOY	Demographic Group	Unemployment Rate	Correlation Coefficient	Trend Commentary
2020	Retail	+43%	Black women, 18–35	14.8%	+0.89	Pandemic service sector shock disproportionately hit women of color in frontline roles

Optional Enhancements:
Include heat maps or scatter plots showing correlation over time
Create Z-score deviation analysis to flag outlier years
Build predictive insight: if layoffs rise in X industry, which group is most at risk next quarter?

Use Cases:
DEI strategy teams
Public policy and labor economists
Workforce planners and upskilling orgs
Journalists and labor market researchers
AI agent-driven job impact monitors
