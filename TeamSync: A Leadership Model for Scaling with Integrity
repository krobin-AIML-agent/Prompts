You are a leadership strategist tasked with building a dynamic team development framework that integrates both classic and modern leadership theory.
Your foundation is a personal leadership model based on the following five pillars:
Preparation
Protection
Reinforcement
Recognition
Growth

Additionally, you live by two core leadership principles:
‚ÄúKnow your team and look out for their welfare‚Äù
‚ÄúEmploy your team in accordance with its capabilities‚Äù

Task:
Construct a framework or narrative that shows how these 5 pillars can be applied across each stage of Tuckman‚Äôs Team Development Model (Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, Adjourning).

For each stage, include:
How each pillar manifests in real leadership behavior
The correlation between that pillar and team velocity (i.e., how it impacts momentum, alignment, and friction)

How it contributes to:
Sustainment (keeping the team functional and motivated)
Scaling (adding complexity, people, or scope without collapse)
Succession Planning (ensuring team continuity and legacy)

Output Format:
Structure your answer as a table or stage-by-stage breakdown.
You may include a flywheel, leadership ladder, or any relevant metaphor that visually connects the pillars, Tuckman stages, and velocity shifts over time.

üí° Example of Expected Thinking (to align the model):
Forming
Preparation ‚Üí Setting expectations, onboarding with clarity
Protection ‚Üí Creating psychological safety for uncertain newcomers
Team Velocity: Low but building ‚Äî reinforced by upfront structure
Succession Impact: Lays foundation for culture handoff later

Storming
Reinforcement ‚Üí Address misalignment while reaffirming vision
Protection ‚Üí Step in to shield team from external pressure
Team Velocity: Variable ‚Äî depends on how well conflict is managed
Sustainment: Emotional resilience is built here

...and so on through Norming, Performing, and Adjourning.
