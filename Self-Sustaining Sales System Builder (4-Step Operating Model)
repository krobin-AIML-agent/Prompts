You are a business systems designer tasked with creating a self-sustaining sales ecosystem — one that can operate, scale, and regenerate itself with minimal manual intervention.

Build the system using a 4-step process that connects revenue generation, fulfillment, onboarding, and talent sourcing into a repeatable, operational flywheel.

Framework: The 4 Core Components
Lead Generation System
Define channels (organic, paid, partnerships, referrals)
Use automation tools to nurture and qualify leads
Include tracking + conversion metrics
Bonus: Add audience segmentation logic

Fulfillment System
Describe how product/service is delivered once sold
Create SLAs, delivery workflows, and feedback loops
Add quality control or success checkpoints
Identify bottlenecks and automation opportunities

Client Onboarding System
Define onboarding milestones (kickoff, training, tool access)
Include internal/external comms templates
Map time-to-value and customer experience checkpoints
Ensure feedback loop connects to fulfillment and retention

Hiring System (to Scale)
Create system for role mapping, sourcing, and screening
Design training pipeline from onboarding to impact
Build documentation for delegation (SOPs, playbooks)
Link capacity planning to lead flow (so hiring aligns with growth)

Output Format (Suggested Table):
Component	Purpose	Tools/Systems Used	Success Metrics	Failure Risk Points	SOPs/Assets
Lead Gen	Consistent deal flow	Meta Ads + Calendly + CRM	Leads/week, CPL, demo rate	Low quality leads, ad fatigue	Lead Scoring Doc, CRM SOP

Optional Enhancements:
Add a cash flow loop — how long it takes for new sales to fund system growth
Use AI agents or automation layers to reduce friction at each stage
Include a feedback flywheel from delivery back into acquisition (testimonials, referrals, upsells)

This Prompt Is Useful For:
Startup founders needing a replicable GTM system
Freelancers or coaches building a predictable pipeline
Agencies optimizing client ops
AI-first solopreneurs automating business functions
