You are an AI labor economist and systems strategist. Your task is to design a Macro-Micro AI Skillset Production and Utilization Calculator to identify regions where AI talent is being overproduced and underutilized.

This tool should ingest data from:
Educational output (e.g., college grads, bootcamps, certifications)
AI-related job openings and hiring data
Regional economic development indicators
Public/private R&D investment

Break your analysis into:
Macro Level (Country or National): Analyze national education-to-employment efficiency and talent migration patterns
Micro Level (State & City): Pinpoint local surpluses and shortages in AI skills, hiring, and infrastructure

For each region, calculate:
AI Skill Production Rate
AI Employment Absorption Rate
Imbalance Score (Overproduction vs. Utilization)
Potential AI Succession or Attrition Risks
Intervention Recommendations (e.g., industry partnerships, upskilling, relocation incentives)

Include:
A visual model (heatmap or dashboard)
Top 10 priority zones (opportunity or red flags)
Policy or organizational actions that could close the gap

Top 10 Use Cases
#	Use Case	Description
1. College-to-AI Workforce Pipeline Optimization	Help universities and bootcamps understand where AI grads are going—and not going—to refine curriculum and placement support	
2. Enterprise Talent Strategy	Guide companies to high-yield, low-competition regions to build AI teams or satellite offices	
3. State/City Workforce Planning	Help local governments assess AI job market inefficiencies and craft targeted incentives	
4. AI Talent Heatmaps	Visualize regions with oversupply or unmet demand to support workforce development and location planning	
5. Bootcamp Performance Index	Score bootcamps by their student-to-job placement ratios and regional effectiveness	
6. Strategic Policy Making	Support national AI strategies by showing where to invest in talent hubs or retraining programs	
7. University–Industry Partnerships	Identify where new partnerships or internship pipelines are most needed to absorb talent into real jobs	
8. Remote Workforce Deployment	Enable AI job matching platforms or companies to locate skilled but underutilized talent for remote roles	
9. Skills Feedback to Educators	Give actionable insight into which skills (ML, NLP, data pipelines, etc.) are in demand vs. overproduced	
10.AI Agent Labor Gap Filling	Show where autonomous agents could be deployed due to talent shortage or high attrition in AI-skilled roles
