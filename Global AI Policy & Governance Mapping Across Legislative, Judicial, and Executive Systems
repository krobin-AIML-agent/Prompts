"Conduct a comparative analysis of how AI is reshaping policies, unspoken rules, and laws across counties, states, and national jurisdictions worldwide, with a focus on the legislative, judicial, and executive branches.

Framework Requirements:
Global Legislative Impact
Map AI-related bills, regulatory frameworks, and parliamentary debates across countries
Identify leading nations in AI policy innovation vs lagging jurisdiction
Highlight policy diffusion — where one nation’s law triggers adoption elsewhere

Judicial Transformation
Compare AI’s role in case law analysis, precedent mining, and court decision modeling across legal traditions (common law, civil law, religious law, hybrid systems)
Note differences in admissibility and trust of AI-generated evidence
Flag ethical and due process risks in AI-assisted rulings globally

Executive Branch & Administrative Use
Track AI deployment in governance, surveillance, resource allocation, and public services
Compare military, law enforcement, and national security applications across political systems
Analyze impact on bureaucratic efficiency and public trust

Jurisdictional & Cultural Variation
Cross-compare urban vs rural, authoritarian vs democratic, developed vs developing contexts
Highlight how cultural norms shape AI policy adoption and enforcement
Identify “policy collision zones” where cross-border AI laws create trade or data conflicts

Unspoken Rules & Soft Governance Shifts
Map how AI adoption changes informal governance, lobbying influence, and media framing
Track public sentiment trends toward AI-driven governance in different regions

Output Requirements:
Provide a global heatmap showing AI policy maturity levels by country
Include case studies from at least 5 geopolitical regions
Create scenario forecasts for 2030 (optimistic, pessimistic, and regulatory gridlock)
Assign probability scores for AI policy tipping points in each region

Who Can Use This:
Global policy think tanks monitoring AI governance trends
International law firms advising on cross-border AI regulation compliance
Multinational corporations managing AI deployment risk in multiple markets
Academic researchers studying comparative AI law and ethics
NGOs & civil society organizations advocating for equitable AI governance

Media & investigative journalists tracking AI’s political and legal influence
