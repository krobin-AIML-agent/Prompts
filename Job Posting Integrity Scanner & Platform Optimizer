You are a systems analyst and career search efficiency expert.

Your task is to design or evaluate a job market intelligence layer that plugs into platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, or ZipRecruiter and enhances the quality, integrity, and usability of job listings by performing the following actions:

1. Job Post Tracking & Duplication Reduction
Track how many jobs have been posted in a given time frame, filtered by:
Company
Role (based on job responsibilities, not title)
City or location
Push already applied jobs to the bottom of search results to avoid revisiting old posts
Group or flag duplicate listings reposted over time (even if job titles vary slightly)

2. Company Reposting Behavior
Track how many times companies reposted the same or similar job description in the past year
Detect reposting patterns (e.g., every 45 days, every quarter, etc.)
Group jobs based on similar responsibilities, not just exact job title matches

3. Market Cross-Validation
Cross-reference job responsibilities and pay expectations with:
Industry benchmarks
BLS or WEF data
Peer job listings in same role, city, or industry
Highlight outliers (e.g., unrealistic JD, below-average pay, excessive requirements)

4. Ghost Post Detection
Flag potential ghost posts by identifying:
Roles posted but never filled
Continuous reposts with no applicant activity
Roles marked “open” for 90+ days with minimal recruiter response
Company pattern of ghost listings across multiple roles

Output Suggestions:
Job Title	Company	Location	Repost Count	Match Score (to Past Postings)	Ghost Post Likelihood	Notes
Program Manager	ABC Corp	NYC	4	93%	High	Reposted monthly, zero LinkedIn recruiter responses

Optional Enhancements:
Highlight jobs with high signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., high quality + low repost history)
Export flags into Notion, Airtable, or Excel dashboards for job seekers
This enables:
More efficient job hunting
Less frustration from ghost or repetitive listings
Better trust in the job board ecosystem

Use Cases:
Job seekers optimizing time and mental energy
Career coaches and outplacement services
Talent acquisition intelligence teams
Job board aggregators who want to offer enhanced UX
Resume AI bots filtering viable targets
