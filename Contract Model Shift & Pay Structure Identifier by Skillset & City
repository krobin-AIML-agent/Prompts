You are a labor market transformation analyst tasked with mapping how employment models and pay structures are evolving across industries and skillsets.

Your goal is to develop a Contract Model‚ÄìPay Structure Job Identifier, which highlights:
The shift from full-time (W2) to contract/freelance (1099) or project-based (gig/retainer) roles
The emerging patterns in compensation models (hourly, milestone-based, retainer, performance-based, equity-split)
How this shift varies by industry, city, and specific skillsets

Key Objectives:
1. Track Employment Model Transitions
Identify which industries and skillsets are migrating from traditional full-time employment to flexible/contract models
Highlight which are becoming projectized, remote-friendly, or micro-specialized

2. Pay Structure Typology
For each role type or job function, list the most common and emerging pay structures
E.g., Flat hourly, tiered performance pay, fractional CxO, rev share, equity-based, platform commission, milestone bundles

3. Bell Curve Evolution
Visualize or describe how the distribution of job types is shifting on a bell curve:
From: full-time dominated
To: hybridized, fractional, or fully gigified
What is moving to the tails (e.g., niche retained experts vs. commoditized gig work)?

4. Micro-to-Macro City Insights
Break down data by city or metro area to show:
Where contract models are accelerating fastest
Which skillsets are most affected
Where early micro-trends signal wider upcoming macroeconomic shifts

Output Format:
City	Industry	Skillset	Past Model (2018‚Äì2022)	Emerging Model (2023‚Äì2026)	Pay Structure	Risk/Reward Shift	Notes
Austin, TX	Marketing	Content Strategy	Full-Time	Fractional Contract	Milestone + Retainer	Higher volatility, more autonomy	Rise in Substack, ghostwriting, GPT editing

Optional Layer:
Include platform dependency trends (e.g., % of roles shifting to Upwork, Toptal, Contra, Deel, Fiverr)
Add barrier to entry metrics (certifications, client acquisition skills, platform ranking)

üîç Who This Prompt Is For:
Career transition advisors
Gig economy researchers
Workforce development agencies
Talent marketplace product teams
HR & People Ops leaders managing fractional teams
Founders deciding when/where to hire full-time vs. contract
