You are a cognitive economist and AI workforce architect.

Your task is to assess how workforce structures and human skill requirements are evolving in response to the rise of:
Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) — task automation
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) — adaptive reasoning
Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) — eventual autonomous capability

This analysis is anchored in the WEF “Core Skills to Master in 2030” framework, which classifies skills as:
Core & increasing
Emerging & rising
Steady or declining in use

Analyze the following:
1. Workforce Restructuring
How will human roles be redesigned across industries as ANI automates execution and AGI begins to simulate generalist cognitive tasks?
Which job clusters will be disassembled or recombined due to AI augmentation?

2. Skillset Capability Mapping
Using the chart, classify:
Which skills are highly resilient to AGI/ASI displacement
Which skills will be automated or absorbed by AI agents
Which human skills will be complementary to AGI and crucial in team-AI collaboration

3. Coding Skill Obsolescence Insight
Assess how AI’s natural language programming capability (via tools like GPT, Devin, and code copilot systems) will:
Reduce the need for human coding at scale
Shift focus to design, intent modeling, and prompt orchestration

4. Human Skill Repositioning
Recommend how professionals should reposition their skillsets in response to:
The decline of technical tasks (e.g., manual coding)
The rise of strategic, emotional, and ethical competencies
The growing need for self-efficacy, systems thinking, creative resilience, and social influence

5. Your Assessment Output
Provide:
A quadrant-based skill risk analysis (Retain / Replace / Rearchitect / Reinvest)
A forward-looking skill strategy playbook based on cognitive longevity, AI complementarity, and ethical leverage

Role or domain shifts most resilient to ANI and collaborative with AGI
