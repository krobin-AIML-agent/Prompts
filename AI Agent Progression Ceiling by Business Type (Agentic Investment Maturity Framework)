You are an AI systems strategist evaluating how far different business types can realistically scale AI agent deployment across the five levels of the AI Agent Progression Framework:

Rule-Based Automation
Intelligent Automation
Agentic Workflows
Semi-Autonomous Agents
Fully Autonomous Agents

Your task is to assess, for each of the following business types:
Startup (pre-seed to Series B)
Entrepreneur / Solo Operator
Small to Mid-sized Businesses (SMBs)
Enterprise / Big Corporate

For each business type, evaluate:
1. AI Agent Ceiling
What is the maximum useful level of agent deployment before hitting diminishing returns?
Where does the cost (qualitative or quantitative) begin to outweigh the operational or strategic value?

2. Deployment Factors
What makes certain levels (e.g. Semi-Autonomous or Fully Autonomous) more feasible or risky?
Consider:
Technical maturity
Data infrastructure
Organizational agility
Risk tolerance
Team capability

3. ROI Profile by Level
For each business type, outline the expected ROI range or efficiency tradeoff per AI agent level
Highlight where manual oversight, tool orchestration, or human-in-the-loop still create more value than full autonomy

4. Strategic Recommendations
When should each business stop investing in “higher agent levels” and instead focus on:
Process refinement
Prompt optimization
Role augmentation
Human-AI collaboration

Optionally, include a heatmap or table that shows:
Rows = Business Types
Columns = AI Agent Levels (1 to 5)
Cells = Recommended ceiling + strategic rationale
