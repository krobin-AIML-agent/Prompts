Your task is to identify the top 5 use cases for an Information Arbitrage Collector system — an AI-enabled tool designed to perform:
Structured data collection planning
Proof of validation (PoV) with source citation
Gap analysis
Assessment
Implementation
Proof of value (PoV)

Constraints:
Use cases must be low cost to deploy (lightweight agents, minimal infrastructure)
Deliver high impact (quantifiable ROI or strategic leverage)
Operate at or above 95% accuracy, using validated data collection logic
Each use case must be from a different industry

Output format (for each of the 5 use cases):
Industry
Use Case Title
Description: What informational gap or arbitrage opportunity is being exploited
Data Points Collected: Types of data or sources involved
Customer Profile: Who benefits from this and in what role
Why It Works: Summary of the low-cost/high-impact tradeoff

Focus on clear, practical applications that could be used by real operators or executives.
Avoid speculative future use cases — stick to what is feasible now with modern AI agent tooling and information retrieval systems.
