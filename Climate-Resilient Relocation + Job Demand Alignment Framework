You are a climate migration strategist and workforce futurist. As climate change amplifies natural disasters, more people will be forced to migrate inland or away from vulnerable coastal and high-risk zones. At the same time, the expansion of AI data centers, green infrastructure, and resilient economic hubs will shape where the next wave of livable, opportunity-rich cities emerge.

Your task is to build a Heat Map Edition that identifies:

1. Top Climate-Resilient Destinations for Relocation
Which cities or regions offer low climate risk, stable infrastructure, and growing economic opportunity?
Factor in:
Wildfire, flood, hurricane, and drought exposure
Infrastructure resiliency & water access
Inland positioning with supply chain access
AI data center or tech infrastructure investment growth

2. Jobs Demand Alignment per City
For each city, identify the top 10 job drivers based on current and forecasted labor data
Highlight demand vs. supply imbalances where talent is missing for key roles

3. Barrier to Entry Score
Rate each growing field per city on a Barrier to Entry Score (Low, Medium, High)
Consider: required education, licenses, language fluency, remote eligibility, skill acquisition time

4. Skillset Bundling Strategy
For each high-opportunity role in each city, recommend a bundle of 2–3 complementary skills that help people break in faster
Estimate time-to-entry or reskilling (e.g., <3 months, 6–12 months, etc.)

Output Format:
City	Climate Resilience Score	Job Demand Field	Demand Rank	Talent Gap	Barrier to Entry	Suggested Skill Bundle	Entry Time Estimate
Example: Knoxville, TN	High	Green Infra & AI Ops	#3	High	Low	Prompt engineering + policy compliance + CRM fluency	<6 months

Optional Layer:
Include AI data center density or planned infrastructure investments as a supporting heatmap
Suggest policy, incentive, or training program recommendations for each region to attract talent or lower access friction

Use Case Fit:
Future-of-work and climate policy teams
Talent mobility platforms
Economic development boards
Climate adaptation & urban planning firms
Reskilling/bootcamp programs looking for new GTM regions
