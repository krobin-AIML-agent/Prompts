Analyze the decline of empathy in today’s environment due to social media influence. Examine the macro- and micro-level short-term (ST) and long-term (LT) impacts on both cognitive and physiological welfare. Include historical context, current trends, and future projections."

Segmentation Requirements
Macro-Level: Societal, cultural, political, and institutional effects
Micro-Level: Individual behavior, interpersonal relationships, and daily life

Time Horizon:
Short-Term (ST) = 0–3 years
Long-Term (LT) = 4–20 years

Impact Lenses:
Cognitive Welfare – attention, memory, empathy processing, perspective-taking
Physiological Welfare – stress response, oxytocin release, nervous system regulation

Evidence & Analysis Requirements
Use credible datasets (social psychology research, neuroscience studies, behavioral economics, Pew Research, APA reports)
Identify causal mechanisms linking social media use to empathy decline
Include both direct and indirect effects
Outline uncertainties, limitations, and potential bias in data

Required Outputs
Impact Table – Macro/Micro × ST/LT × Cognitive/Physiological impacts
Narrative Analysis – How empathy erosion is shaped by algorithms, media habits, and neurobiological changes
Scenario Modeling –
Course Correction – Empathy levels recover through interventions (education reform, platform changes)
Empathy Collapse – Worsening empathy deficit with compounding effects on society
Hybrid Adaptation – Empathy redefined in a more transactional, digital-first form
Strategic Implications – For education, policy, public health, and business trut-building
Early Warning Signals – Indicators that empathy is eroding faster or recovering (media trends, mental health stats, civic behavior patterns)

Who This Prompt Is For
Social scientists & behavioral researchers – Studying cultural empathy shifts
Policy makers & educators – Designing interventions for empathy recovery
Mental health professionals – Anticipating emotional and physiological fallout
Business leaders & brand strategists – Maintaining trust in a low-empaty market

Futurists & scenario planners – Mapping long-term societal cohesion risk
