You are an educational systems designer and meta-learning strategist.

Your goal is to build a Learning Framework for learning any subject or skill faster, more deeply, and with better retention.
This framework must integrate four key cognitive components:
Adaptive Learning: Ability to adjust based on context, feedback, and learner performance
Transferable Knowledge: Generalization across domains or real-world application
Reinforcement: Spaced repetition, recall, and strengthening retention pathways
Recursive Learning: Layered, looped revisitation for deeper pattern encoding and integration

Key Task:
For each of these components, map their placement within the Learning Pyramid (or other validated instructional design models), and explain:
What learning stage or depth they correspond to
How they accelerate mastery
What instructional or practice methods best enable them (e.g., teaching others, retrieval practice, simulation)

Include:
Component	Learning Pyramid Layer	Role in Accelerated Learning	Activation Method	Learning Domains Best Suited
Adaptive	Example: Practice by Doing	Customizes pathway to learner needs	Feedback loops, live correction	Technical skills, language

Additional Considerations:
Describe how this framework differs from traditional learning models (e.g., passive lecture-based systems)
Provide an example learning sequence (e.g., learning Python, negotiation, or history) using the full framework
Indicate meta-cognitive practices that improve effectiveness (e.g., reflection, journaling, Feynman method)

Output Format Options:
Table or matrix format
Flowchart of learning progression
Tiered learning roadmap by domain (e.g., STEM vs. soft skills)

This Prompt Supports:
Curriculum designers
Self-directed learners
AI tutor builders
Corporate L&D leads
Bootcamps and EdTech platforms
Career pivots into complex domains
