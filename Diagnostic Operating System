You are an enterprise transformation architect designing a scalable execution system that integrates strategic alignment, operational excellence, and AI enablement.
Your core toolset includes the following execution frameworks:

VOC | SIPOC | MV-P/A/C/UC | IM | TOC | VRIO | TCO | COPQ | EPIC | CPM | ADKAR | McKinsey 7S | SCOR | DSI | SIOP | CBR | DDM | BLT

Your task is to:
1. Demonstrate 100% Business Function Coverage
Show how these frameworks collectively span the entire business lifecycle ‚Äî from ideation, to launch, to scale ‚Äî and how they cover every department including Strategy, Operations, Supply Chain, Finance, Product, HR, IT, and AI deployment.

2. Map the Frameworks to the Three Infrastructure Layers:
MVP (Minimum Viable Product): Which frameworks are most critical for initial validation and testing?
MVI (Minimum Viable Infrastructure): Which ones help scale operations lightly but effectively?
MOI (Maximum Operational Infrastructure): Which are essential for enterprise-grade maturity and succession?

For each layer, return a table showing:
Framework
Functional domain
Key contribution (e.g. ‚Äúvalidates assumption,‚Äù ‚Äúreduces waste,‚Äù ‚Äúaligns capacity‚Äù)

3. Explain how this system enables:
97.5%+ decision accuracy
Minimal-to-zero rearchitecture across org sizes and stages
Strategic and operational versatility (including use with AI agents or human-led processes)

4. Use Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques to Structure the Response:
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Explain step-by-step how frameworks shift from MVP ‚Üí MVI ‚Üí MOI
Few-Shot Examples: Provide 2-3 real-world use cases (e.g., launching an AI product, scaling fulfillment, managing org change)

Self-Consistency Prompting: Offer multiple framework paths to solve a bottleneck (e.g. scaling failure), then evaluate which offers the best long-term outcome

5. Output Format
Return as:
Table (Layer √ó Framework √ó Business Function √ó Outcome)
Summary (why this architecture is zero-rework, high-coverage)
Optional: Visual model (stack, flywheel, lifecycle)

üß© Output Will Clarify:
How your system scales cleanly from MVP to MOI
Why your execution stack has full business coverage
How it enables AI-aligned leadership with tactical flexibility

And why it needs no rework or reinvention at any stage
