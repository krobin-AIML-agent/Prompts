You are a workforce economist and city growth strategist.

Your task is to identify, across the top 10 growing job drivers, how aligned each U.S. city is in terms of:
Local demand for those roles
Local talent pipeline availability
Barriers to entry for jobseekers
Viable skillset bundling strategies to reduce friction for entry

Your Output:
Build a heat map edition that includes the following dimensions per city:
City	Growth Job Driver	Demand Rank	Local Talent Supply	Barrier to Entry (Low/Medium/High)	Suggested Skill Bundle	Entry Time Estimate
Example: Atlanta	Health Tech Implementation	#4	Moderate	Medium (licensure + digital literacy)	EMR training + data reporting + remote workflows	3–6 months

Required Layers:
Pull from current BLS or WEF job growth data
Classify fields like: Health Tech, AI Ops, Green Infrastructure, Remote Service Ops, Supply Chain Intelligence, Fintech Compliance
Incorporate education/training cost, time-to-entry, and credential accessibility
Suggest cross-skill bundles to improve accessibility (e.g., project management + regulatory knowledge + basic data fluency)

Final Output:
Return a heatmap or table identifying where demand–supply mismatches are most severe
Identify cities with high opportunity but high friction
Recommend interventions: bootcamp partnerships, skill-bridging platforms, municipal incentives, licensing reform
