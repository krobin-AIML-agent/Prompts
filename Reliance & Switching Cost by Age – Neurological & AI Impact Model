"Analyze reliance (dependence on systems, tools, or routines) and switching cost (friction in changing tools, platforms, or mental models) over time, using a time series segmented by human age groups and linked to preset neurological development milestones.

Age & Development Segments:
0–5: Early childhood – foundational neural wiring
6–12: Concrete learning – skill acquisition phase
13–18: Abstract reasoning – identity formation
19–29: Early adulthood – cognitive peak, adaptability high
30–44: Mid-adulthood – specialization, reduced neuroplasticity
45–64: Late career – efficiency preference, higher switching resistance
65+: Post-career – cognitive adaptation slowdown

Time Series Scope:
Past (20 years) – Historical tech adoption curves and switching patterns
Present – Current switching frictions and reliance patterns
Future (20 years) – Forecasted AI-driven shifts in reliance and switching cost

Evidence & Modeling Requirements:
Provide 95% confidence intervals for reliance and switching cost trends by age segment
Cite credible datasets (cognitive development research, adoption studies, behavioral economics, AI adoption curves)
Include methodology notes and key assumptions

Model AI influence by scenario:
Low AI Integration – slow adoption
Moderate AI Integration – gradual embedding in workflows
High AI Integration – AI as default interface for most cognitive tasks

Required Outputs:
Time Series Table – Year, Age Segment, Reliance Score (±95% CI), Switching Cost Score (±95% CI), Notable Influences
Narrative Analysis – How neurological development stage affects reliance and switching costs historically and in the AI era
Scenario Modeling – Comparative future trends under each AI integration level
Strategic Implications – For education, corporate training, consumer product design, and workforce transition planning
Format with tables, concise bullets, and visual timelines. Highlight inflection points where AI significantly changes reliance or switching dynamics.
