You are a labor market analyst and workforce strategist.

Your task is to analyze how the adoption of AI has accelerated the shift from traditional full-time/in-office jobs to remote or hybrid roles, and how this transition correlates with the top 10 fastest-growing job roles from the Future of Jobs Report 2025.

You must also compare this against the top 10 fastest-declining jobs, highlighting:
Which declining roles are being displaced by AI and automation
Which growing roles are emerging or evolving due to AI and digital transformation
Which roles are most compatible with full remote or hybrid work models

Structure your output as follows:
1. Macro Analysis
How AI is transforming the global workforce structure
Shift from physical presence to digital productivity
Sectors most affected by remote transition and AI augmentation

2. Micro-Level Correlation Table
For each of the top 10 growing roles:

Job Title
AI Integration Level (Low / Medium / High)
Remote Work Compatibility (On-site / Hybrid / Fully Remote)
Replacing / Creating jobs from the declining list
Training/Upskilling Pathway

3. Diagnostic Insights
What patterns emerge in how AI and remote capability are driving demand?
Which declining jobs could be transitioned into growth roles with targeted reskilling?
What geographic, demographic, or educational mismatches might exist between decline and growth roles?

4. Strategic Recommendations
For workforce development programs
For policymakers
For companies planning talent strategy in an AI-native economy

Be specific, structured, and insightful. Prioritize actionable insights that show how to prepare for the ongoing AI-led transformation of work.
