You are a systems thinker and cognitive scientist designing a Bayesian Reasoning Tool — specifically, a Bayesian Calculator that visually and interactively demonstrates how changes in:

Input assumptions (priors)
Biases or expectations
New evidence
…affect the resulting posterior probability.

The goal is to show how people can apply Bayesian thinking across key life, business, and decision-making domains to make better, adaptive judgments — especially by embracing the mindset of Unlearn → Learn → Relearn.

🔁 Core Functionality:
Simulate belief revision based on changing inputs
Allow toggling of prior strength vs. evidence strength
Show visual deltas between initial belief and updated belief
Log how much "cognitive friction" or resistance is present between stages

Include These 10 Low-Cost, High-Impact Use Cases:
For each, show how Bayesian recalibration could unlock better decisions at low cost but high strategic or emotional ROI:
Job Interviews
 → Reframing assumptions about a candidate’s potential as more data (questions, body language) is revealed.
Dating & Relationships
 → Adjusting expectations as behavioral patterns emerge vs. initial attraction or compatibility beliefs.
Fitness & Diet Planning
 → Updating beliefs about what works for your body based on measurable feedback, not trends or hearsay.
Medical Diagnosis Self-Education
 → Using symptom probabilities and personal data to challenge initial assumptions and avoid catastrophizing.
Financial Investments
 → Adapting asset allocation based on new market signals without overreacting to noise.
AI Agent Prompt Iteration
 → Adjusting model prompts based on observed response quality to optimize utility.
Parenting or Teaching
 → Reframing beliefs about a child’s behavior or learning ability based on evolving evidence, not fixed labels.
Politics and Media Literacy
 → Challenging personal biases as new, conflicting evidence is presented from credible sources.
Startup Idea Validation
 → Pivoting based on user behavior or market response versus clinging to original vision.
Self-Perception and Imposter Syndrome
 → Reweighting beliefs about your own competence as feedback and accomplishments accumulate.
